                Starbreeze has cancelled the co-op Dungeons and Dragons game it announced in
                2023 in order to focus its resources on the Payday franchise—and also reduce its resources, because
                yes, the cancellation of the game also means layoffs.
            </p>
            <h2>Why it is happening?</h2>
            <p>
                Project Baxter, as the D&D game was known internally, was meant to be "the next AAA title in
                [Starbreeze's] niche of cooperative multiplayer games," which sounds vaguely Payday-like, but also "a
                completely new project, in a completely new genre, compared to Payday." The mystery of what Starbreeze
                actually intended will remain, however, because we never saw anything more of it than that initial
                announcement and a couple of very generic pieces of fantasy-styled concept art.
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>     "Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and
                potential," Kristjansson said. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery,
                engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze’s position as the clear leader in the
                heisting genre.</p>

            </div>
            <p>
                The Payday 3 development will also be expanded to about 50 employees by the end of 2025 (Starbreeze didn't say how many people are on the Payday 3 dev team now, so whether that represents a doubling in size or a couple of extra people is unknown), "and continue to grow in line with increased player engagement."
            </p>
            <p>With this move, Starbreeze doubles down on its most successful franchise, signaling a retreat from risky new IPs in favor of reinforcing its live-service backbone.</p>
