        <div class="article_content">
            <p>
                Ever since the release of Destiny 2's Edge of Fate expansion, developer Bungie has been busy fixing the
                many problems created by this very expansion. Amid widespread community pushback and series-low player
                counts on Steam, the studio's just announced another major U-turn: Destiny 2's Unstable Cores are being
                removed entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unstable Cores were introduced in Edge of Fate as the new infusion fodder used to increase the Power
                level of a piece of gear. Bungie is physically incapable of not releasing new currencies, and this one
                proved particularly problematic. High infusion costs, difficult activity modifiers, and reward payouts
                based on equipped Power actively discouraged buildcrafting experimentation and added yet another tedious
                grind to the to-do list. You had to infuse stuff, but it would cost you an arm and a leg in cores, so it
                was extremely difficult to get multiple builds up to snuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a stark demonstration of the system's failure and incongruity, high-level infusion would cost
                thousands of cores while the game's battle pass would hand out dozens. Virtually everyone hated this on
                sight, and Bungie has finally seen sense.
            </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    "We have landed on a plan to fully deprecate this currency," Bungie says in a new update. "Once
                    deprecated, infusion will cost an amount of Enhancement Cores and Glimmer."
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Bungie admits "Unstable Cores have been too restrictive across power levels and fail to drive
                interesting buildcraft decisions, whether they be powering up through Campaign missions and wanting to
                try different weapons, or going into Endgame content and looking to infuse lower-level gear to higher
                power levels."
            </p>
            <p>
                With that in mind, cores are being removed, though Bungie does not have a release timeline for this
                change just yet, and a one-time bonus of 777,777 cores is being handed out to smooth things over. A
                smaller update reducing infusion costs at "higher Power levels" is also coming ahead of the larger
                deprecation patch and economy rebalancing. Here's an idea: reduce all costs to one (1) core now that
                we're all openly in agreement that this system sucks and should not have happened.
