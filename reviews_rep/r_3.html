                A triumphant combination of enthralling combat, top-tier creature and character design, and a
                captivating open world, Horizon Forbidden West is an absolute blast and fantastic showcase for the power
                of the PS5. Although the return of a couple of familiar series trappings and a noticeable lack of
                freeform climbing never threatens to derail the enjoyment, it does leave it falling frustratingly short
                of something revolutionary. Major evolutionary steps have firmly been placed in the right direction,
                however, and there’s no doubting the many, many hours of fun to have with Aloy, who stakes her claim
                further to be one of this generation of gaming’s greatest characters. Guerrilla has outdone itself yet
                again with Forbidden West, and at this trajectory, neither the horizon nor the sky's the limit for what
                could come next.

                <p>A triumphant combination of enthralling combat, top-tier creature and character design, and a
                    captivating open world, Horizon Forbidden West is an absolute blast and fantastic showcase for the
                    power of the PS5.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Take the Power Back</h2>
            <p>
                Once again, Aloy is on a time-sensitive mission packed with mystery, not least in its characters, many
                of whom are firmly established in the grey area between friend or foe. Its twists and turns are numerous
                and had me guessing how it would turn out right until the end of Aloy's journey. That journey isn't a
                short one; my playthrough (which was done at a fairly relaxed pace that included completing a healthy
                amount of side missions) took around 32 hours.
            </p>
            <h2>Forbidden West is able to confidently stride over the deep exposition potholes that Zero Dawn sometimes
                fell victim to. </h2>
            <p>
                This is still very much a hard sci-fi setting, though, and that is where the slightly weaker parts of
                Forbidden West’s story lay during the opening hours. Sometimes it just can't help but stray into
                overlong monologues referring back to the events of Zero Dawn and the setup for the journey west, and
                that’s where some momentum is lost. This makes for an uneven start, but the pace promptly picks up and
                becomes much more engaging once a new threat is introduced and the true plot of Forbidden West comes to
                the fore. From here on it successfully rumbles on its way to a full-on bonkers, yet highly enjoyable
                ending. It's also worth noting here that Forbidden West is very much a sequel to Zero Dawn, meaning
                newcomers attempting to skip the line and jump in here may feel slightly alienated by the overarching
                plot, though there's still plenty to enjoy regardless.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Aloy's quest collides with other people's stories to create something truly memorable.
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are fantastic character moments that are delivered with a deft touch; it's a credit to the writers
                that I found myself caring so much about the fate of these people so quickly after meeting them. This
                goes for the actors embodying the characters, too – performances are brilliant across the board, with no
                one feeling out of place and even the most incidental seeming characters well observed. That’s no mean
                feat considering the large cast of fresh faces you'll meet throughout your playthrough.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Angela Bassett and Carrie-Anne Moss bring salvos of Hollywood-caliber firepower to the story.
            </h2>
            <p>
                On the topic of the loud parts, while Zero Dawn may have been action-packed, its presentation never felt
                nearly as cinematic as this. Massive moments take place in masterfully choreographed cutscenes with
                swirling camerawork reminiscent of a Tony Scott chase sequence. It may seem simple, but subtler
                techniques (such as a wider lens used during conversations) add a filmic quality to dialogue-heavy
                scenes, allowing characters to use their bodies to move expressively and convey a wider range of
                emotion. Feelings run high over the course of the lengthy campaign, and while this isn’t anything like
                the trauma fest of something like The Last of Us Part 2, Forbidden West certainly tugs on the
                heartstrings.
