                Sequels are opportunities to either build upon a predecessor and push boundaries, or refine what was
                already great and deliver that again with a stronger focus. With Ghost of Yotei, developer Sucker Punch
                leaned heavily into the latter approach, and the result is more captivating open-world action and
                unbelievably striking visuals at every turn. It doesn't try to revolutionize things, sticking pretty
                close to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima in general, but I don’t necessarily mind when that means it can expand
                in aspects that matter and offer a tighter distillation of the samurai fantasy that was originally
                promised. Not many games in recent memory can hang their hat on having combat as fluid and satisfying as
                this, and it's packed into a revenge tale that makes for a more human story.
            </p>

                A predictable but well-executed story takes you through Ghost of Yotei's gorgeous landscapes and satisfying, fluid action – it may not be revolutionizing open world games, but it's a great distillation of the samurai fantasy.
            </div>
            <h2>It's a story far less concerned about the romanticized idea of the samurai.</h2>
            <p>
                That's not to say it doesn't have its moments, however. A couple of clever twists in a middle chapter
                show signs of brilliance, and some bittersweet scenes throughout had me emotionally invested in ways I
                didn't expect. Atsu has a few companions on her journey, like Oyuki who is one of the standouts and adds
                a little depth with her wisdom and contrasting perspective on the revenge motif. So is Atsu's mom, who
                brings texture to Yotei's themes of music and family being tied together, as you see through childhood
                flashbacks that flesh out their past. But when it came time for Atsu to square up against one of her
                targets, I couldn't help but grin, sit forward for the fight, and sense that intensity of dealing a
                final blow. Although I wish it took more creative swings with its storytelling, it is a strong-enough
                vehicle to carry you through what it does best.

            <h2>Few games in recent memory have combat as fluid and satisfying as this.</h2>

                Stealth is still a prominent part of the mix, but largely relies on basic mechanics we've seen time and
                again in these kinds of action games. Tall grass and enemies with their backs conveniently turned and no
                vertical vision; we know the deal. I won't deny that an aerial assassination or triple-kill chain feels
                great in the moment, though, and let me shout out the kusarigama ranged assassination one more time.
                Broadly speaking, there's seemingly a lighter emphasis on stealth than we saw in Tsushima, and Yotei
                never really pushes you hard in that direction – if you get caught, then you just fight, like…oh no, I
                have to engage in combat, the best part of this game! What a shame! I found that teeing up as many
                stealth kills as possible before going loud to be the most enjoyable way to play, and it seems like
                Sucker Punch understood how to make that approach work well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yotei's main questline does hit you with a handful of large-scale battles to drive a sense of scale, but
                feature plenty of duels are spread throughout its world, packaged as deadly boss fights where you're
                chipping away at their stagger meter and health. Here, mastering the timing of parrying and dodging is
                of utmost importance, and even though they play out quite similarly, I still got a kick out of
                connecting on multiple parries in succession (lest I get one-tapped myself). Parrying and countering is
                one of the great joys in games, and Yotei delivers wonderfully – I see that blue glint, I lock in. So
                much so that I almost exclusively played with the Bounty Master armor equipped, which disables normal
                parries to slightly increase the perfect parry timing window. And it was worth the high-risk and high
                reward because nothing is cooler in this series than flawlessly deflecting an attack and slicing an
                enemy Bushido Blade-style. Standoffs are back, letting you go mano-a-mano to kill an enemy (or two or
                three) in a timing-based Iai sword swipe before going all-out on the rest of your foes; it's another way
                Yotei (like Tsushima before it) adds a satisfying variety to combat.
