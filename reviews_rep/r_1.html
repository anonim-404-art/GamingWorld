                Hollow Knight: Silksong has managed to live up to my high expectations, taking a game I absolutely
                adored and quite literally turning its dash into a full-on sprint. It’s bigger, more vibrant, and just
                as creative as the original sprawling epic, and it tweaks every system in largely smart ways. Some of
                its quests and an oddly structured finale do make small missteps, but Team Cherry has nailed the overall
                balance between satisfying 2D platforming challenges, enticing exploration of a beautiful and surprising
                world, and nail-biting combat with thrilling boss battles in a way few games do. It’s also
                unapologetically challenging in all of that, punishing you in a way that can occasionally sting but
                never feels unforgiving, giving you both huge obstacles to surmount and plenty of tools to figure out
                how to do so. It asks you to face down the unbeatable and overcome the things holding you back while
                still taking care of yourself and those around you, and to leave the world a better place than you found
                it in the end – no matter how impossible that might seem.
            </p>

                Hollow Knight: Silksong is packed full of sharp platforming, enticing exploration, and nail-biting combat that's all unapologetically challenging in just the right way.

            <h2>
                Hornet is an excellent hero and Pharloom is a fascinating world.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Pharloom is a fascinating place as well: a dying land where hopeful bugs go on a pilgrimage from its lower levels all the way up to the shining peak of a spectacular cogwork city called The Citadel in blind service of their faith – though few actually survive the trek you now inadvertently find yourself on. One of the greatest strengths of games as a creative medium is how they can tie themes and actions together. For example, part of the reason I gave Celeste a 10 back in 2018 was because of how it made you experience Madeline’s struggle to overcome her own personal mountain by making you climb a literal one. Silksong pulls off a similar trick: it’s about being tested and overcoming, about leaving the world a better place than you found it even when that’s hard to do, and about persevering while still making time to give yourself grace in the face of defeat. You don’t need to read a single line of dialogue to feel those themes through the actions you are taking alone.
            </p>
            <h2>
Combat rewards patience and spatial awareness over button timings alone.
            </h2>
            <p>
               Those aggressive enemies and brutal boss fights follow the same “go with the flow” philosophy as the areas around them: if you face them like this is one of the more typical 3D action games Hollow Knight clearly takes some inspiration from, you might find yourself having a rough time. But if you treat Silksong as the platformer it really is, staying patient enough to focus on positioning while dodging and getting damage in where you can, then even its most savage enemies will start to melt. It has become a cliche to call combat a “dance” nowadays, but it truly is the best way to describe some of these encounters. Silksong isn’t the most mechanically nuanced action game in the world, but learning an enemy’s patterns as you fall into a rhythm of dodging a swing, dashing in for a hit, hopping to safety, and then repeating really does feel like a bit of blade-based choreography that rewards spatial awareness over button timings alone.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Desperately searching for a bench teeters on the line between thrilling danger and mounting dread.
            </h2>
            <p>
               A similarly rough feeling can be caused by a few areas that put their respawn benches extremely far apart, even turning a handful into “gotcha” traps that savagely pull the rug out from under you when you think you’ve finally found relief. I actually think those traps are hilarious, but desperately searching for a checkpoint when you are first exploring a new area teeters on the line between thrilling danger in uncharted territory and a “what am I doing wrong here?” sense of dread. However, this bench placement isn’t some mistake done without regard; just like a boss has to be learned and overcome, the challenge of the areas that use benches more sparingly is surviving to find one, and finally doing so is as satisfying as taking down any big bug. Silksong is a true-blue platformer at its heart, and mastering its precise movement options across devious, spike-covered obstacle courses was a real treat.
            </p>
            <h2>
                The list of things waiting to be discovered across Pharloom is extensive.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Of course, you have to find all of these different options first, and the laundry list of things waiting to be discovered across Pharloom is extensive. I always try to complete as many side tasks as I can before heading down the “correct” path in games like this, letting myself get distracted by friendly NPCs and the quests they post on boards in the small handful of towns you’ll come across. When I finally reached the end, my in-game timer was at just over 44 hours played and 96% completion. Was that enough Silksong for me? No – I’m still hungry to dive back in and clear off that last 4% (and I already know where most of it is).
