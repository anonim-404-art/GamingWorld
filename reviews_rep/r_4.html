The expectations around Final Fantasy 7 Remake are sky high, and it mostly manages to deliver. Its combat is top notch, its enemy variety kept me constantly entertained, and seeing this snippet of story fleshed out with real emotional arcs and the previously hidden humanity behind Midgar filled me with pure joy.            </p>
            <div>
                <p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s dull filler and convoluted additions can cause it to stumble, but it still breathes exciting new life into a classic while standing as a great RPG all its own.
</p>
            </div>
            <h2>
Many additions elevated the source material, while others were just dull filler.
            </h2>
            <p>
What I didn’t love, however, was when FF7R clearly decided it needed more stuff, regardless of quality, for the sake of achieving “full” RPG length. The most dull of these pop up whenever Cloud reaches a new residential area of Midgar’s slums – all of which are wonderfully detailed and brimming with life in a way that was truly magical to see realized – where he’ll be asked to do odd jobs as part of his mercenary work (something we previously never saw him do in Midgar outside of his work with Avalanche). The problem is that these are, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the weakest parts of this entire game.
            </p>
            <h2>
The irrelevant padding isn’t limited to side quests.
            </h2>
            <p>
A great example of this is Roche, a brand-new character who shows near the start of the story for an extra motorcycle chase scene (these sequences are still about as thin as the original was in 1997) and a single fight with Cloud, and is then bafflingly never heard from again. Sure, it’s a fun fight, and he’s a cool character, but his inclusion (alongside the entire new scenario around him, for that matter) is so irrelevant to the plot that he stands out like a sore thumb.

Thankfully, regardless of padding, this story is at least told in gorgeous fashion. The cutscenes here are truly magnificent to watch, and the graphics are generally stunning both in and out of them. Not to mention, the music is unbelievably good throughout, featuring excellent remixes of iconic songs that stretch past the walls of Midgar. There is some truly wonderful cinematic spectacle on display here, even if some of that spectacle (like my friend Roche) makes my eyes roll so hard I get dizzy.
            </p>
           <h2>
To Infinity and Beyond
           </h2>
            <p>
One major concern I had before starting FF7R was whether or not this previously brief Midgar section would feel like enough of a complete story on its own, and the result is mixed. Square Enix has done a great job of making this feel like a bigger story, and showing Cloud’s cold merc heart and awkward social demeanor soften over time gives vital character development to a section of the original that didn’t have much. That said, it’s impossible not to feel like this is anything but the setup for a bigger story we don’t actually get to see yet – because it is. I once again became invested in Avalanche’s fight against Shinra, but I was ultimately left wanting a more satisfying conclusion to this story, as well as a little anxious for how the next game might pick up from where this cliffhanger leaves off.
            </p>
            <h2>
A few parts can only be described as "Some Kingdom Hearts BS."
            </h2>
            <p>
Apart from additions that work toward making the world of Midgar and its people feel more real, the theme behind most of FF7R’s newly inserted plot points is one of uproarious spectacle with very little thought. Bear in mind, I was almost always having fun thanks to the excellent combat and I almost always enjoyed what I was seeing thanks to the amazing presentation. The issue isn't that there are new story elements, but that most of them fall apart the moment you think about them too hard.
