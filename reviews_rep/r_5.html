                Red Dead Redemption 2 stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Grand Theft Auto V as one of the greatest games
                of the modern age. It’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge
                amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date.
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Red Dead Redemption Online is the RDR2 online multiplayer experience that uses this vast and
                    atmospheric world in an online world full of challenges in keeping with the Old West way of life.

                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>The Big Country</h2>
            <p>
                The slower pace of Red Dead Redemption 2 compared to something like the slightly more breakneck GTA V is
                also a big part of how it encouraged me to drink in all the world has to offer. Bodies have to be
                manually looted, and Arthur needs to physically manhandle a body to do so. Single-action pistols need to
                be cocked before firing. Guns Arthur isn’t currently carrying need to retrieved from his saddle. Coffee
                needs to be brewed before drinking it.
            </p>
            <h2>
                I spent a good deal of time off-mission simply moseying around, bingeing on the world like a virtual
                museum
            </h2>
            <p>
                At any rate, it’s seriously worth settling into the pace Rockstar is trying to set here because there’s
                just so much to see and hear. You’ll hear unique, one-time conversations that occur in camp after
                certain missions, as well as other bespoke bits of dialogue that reference recent events. Strolling
                through camp, I’ve been privy to everything from a heated bust-up between John Marston and his partner,
                Abigail, to the good-natured con man Hosea Matthews regaling the young Jack Marston with stories of his
                latest fishing adventure. This is all happening around Arthur whether you pause to eavesdrop or not. It
                makes the camp feel like a concentrated version of the world at large, a place with people going about
                their business and interacting with one another completely independently of you. I can’t understate the
                genuine feeling of life this injects into the overall experience for me.
            </p>
            <h2>
                How the West Was Won
            </h2>
            <p>
                The main story missions themselves are a cocktail of high-stakes heists, deadly shootouts, desperate
                rescues, and thrilling chases, mixed with a lengthy list of other activities. Many of those function as
                organic ways to teach us about new side hustles and activities that can be undertaken, from selling
                stolen horses to playing poker or fishing.
            </p>
            <p>
                It all feels great to play, similar in a lot of ways to its immediate predecessor but injected with a
                pile of new animations and multiple layers of interactivity. It asks a lot of the finite amount of
                buttons on a controller, but once I became accustomed to which commands require a tap and which require
                a press-and-hold I had few hassles. Shootouts are supremely cinematic thanks to plenty of gun smoke and
                the same style of on-the-fly, ever-changing death animations that have characterised Rockstar games
                since GTA IV. You can even shoot off people’s hats and pick them up later for yourself.

            </p>
            <h2>
                Once Upon a Time In the West
            </h2>
            <p>
                Red Dead Redemption 2 is an undeniably pretty game across the board. The lighting is fantastic,
                particularly in dark, misty situations where shafts of moonlight stab through the trees, and I love the
                way it handles Arthur leaving weakly-lit interiors into the temporarily blinding sun outside. The
                sunsets are especially spectacular and seem to vary depending on the weather system. Some are harsh and
                beaming while others are warm and soft. The facial animation is a noticeable step up from GTA V, and the
                level of granular detail is almost absurd, from the way blood smears on Arthur’s shoulder after carrying
                a kill to the way individual strands of his majestic mutton chops quiver in the breeze. The way wagon
                wheels become caked in mud. The way rust builds up on a poorly-maintained firearm. It’s another long,
                long list that speaks to a high level of attention to detail.
