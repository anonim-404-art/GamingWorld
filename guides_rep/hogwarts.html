            <p>With the world of magic at your fingertips, it can be difficult to resist the urge to explore everything Hogwarts Legacy offers early on in the game. To make your transition as a new Hogwarts student easier, we've compiled a list of essential things to do before you go around exploring.</p>
            <p>Acquiring your wand, unlocking essential spells, and buying your first broom are things that will make exploring the world of Hogwarts Legacy more effortless. While you can explore the castle and the rest of the Scottish Highlands almost immediately, you may benefit from seeking out a few points of interest first. This tips guide applies to all versions of Hogwarts Legacy, including the original PC, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S versions of Hogwarts Legacy, as well as the Nintendo Switch version.</p>

            <h2>Spend Time Learning Spell Combos</h2>
            <p>Different spells require a secondary attack to make them worthwhile. For example, Incendio can only be done at close range, so combining it with Accio to pull the enemy closer will make the execution much easier.</p>
            <p>You can practice learning multiple spell combos by speaking to Lucan Brattleby by the Clock Tower Courtyard Floo Flame.
            </p>
            <h2>Unlock Floo Flame Locations For Easy Fast Travel</h2>
            <p>Exploring Hogwarts and admiring the magical interior is a massive part of the fun, but going up and down the Grand Staircase to go from one room to another can get tiring quickly.</p>
            <h2>Gain Early XP from Field Guide Pages</h2>
            <p>After unlocking spells like Accio, Levioso, and Reparo, you'll be able to open up new and exciting quests in and out of Hogwarts. In addition, with those spells, you'll able to acquire Field Guide Pages outside of the ones you can only find with Revelio.</p>
            <h2>Craft Your Wand</h2>
            <p>What's a wizard without their unique wands? Having your own wand will allow you to deal more significant damage and equip it with the Wand Handles you collect during your journey. As soon as you get to Hogsmeade for the first time, you'll want to head to Ollivanders southwest of The Three Broomsticks.</p>
            <h2>Interact With Everything</h2>
            <p>The beauty of a magic castle is that almost everything is imbued with charms and spells, which means there is a good chance you'll uncover secrets, collectibles, and equipment just by interacting with random items you see while exploring. For example, interact with the owl statue by the eastern corridor to reveal a hidden room with a treasure chest; or the book inside Tombs and Scrolls in Hogsmeade to reveal a hidden staircase.</p>
            <h2>Complete the Merlin Trials</h2>
            <p>You'll start the game with an infuriatingly small number of slots in your inventory. Completing these Merlin Trials increases your inventory size; otherwise, you will need to destroy or sell some items to make space for new ones.</p>
            <p>You can complete your first Merlin Trial during the Trials for Merlin main quest in Lower Hogsfield—you'll need to finish two of the trials to gain your first gear bonus slots.</p>
