               Whether you’re brand new to first-person shooters or a returning veteran, this CS2 Beginner's Guide will help you get acquainted with Valve’s latest addition to the Counter-Strike family. Below, you'll find an introduction to the basic structure of a CS2 match, and a variety of tips to help you in your first few games.
            </p>
            <h2>
                How to Play CS2
            </h2>
            <p>
                Counter-Strike 2 is a 5v5 competitive FPS featuring two opposing teams: <strong style="color: white"> Terrorist (T)</strong> and <strong style="color: white">Counter-Terrorist (CT)</strong> . You'll play the first half of the match on one team, then the two teams will swap over and you'll play from the opposite side.
            </p>
            <h2>CS2 Rounds</h2>
            <p>Competitive matches work on an MR12 system, which means that there’s 12 rounds per half and your side needs to secure 13 to win overall. If you tie with the enemy team then the match goes into overtime.</p>
            <h2>CS2 Maps/Game Modes</h2>
            <p>There are currently nine maps available to play in CS2’s Competitive mode, eight of which follow the Bomb Defusal format:</p>
            <p>If you’re playing on <strong style="color: white"> T-side</strong>, your goal is to take control of either the A or B bombsite and plant the bomb, eliminating any CTs that get in your way.</p>
            <p>On <strong style="color: white"> CT-side</strong> your job is to stop the Ts from planting, or defuse the bomb if they manage to get that far.</p>
            <h2>CS2 Weapons</h2>
            <p>At the start of each round, you will need to purchase weapons by opening the shop with [TAB]. The funds available to each team will depend on your performance in previous rounds. Money you don't spend will be carried forward and be available to spend next round, so you'll likely see your teammates spend and save strategically to maximize their advantage.</p>
            <div class="image"><div style="background-image: url('https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/counter-strike-2/8/89/CS2-Headshot.jpg?width=617&dpr=2&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80')" class="image_container"></div></div>
            <h2>Watch Your Crosshair Placement</h2>
            <p>As FPS players will know, your first instinct should be to shoot at your opponent’s head. To make this easier to achieve consistently, you'll want to practice keeping your crosshair at the right level to headshot any enemies that may appear.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that CS2’s weapons have noticeable recoil once you’ve fired a few bullets. For the most accurate shots, hold down LMB in short bursts of about one-three bullets and stand still while shooting to maximise your chances of landing lethal headshots. You can crouch for more accuracy, but this also makes you an easier target.</p>
            <div><p>CS2 allows you to customise your crosshair, so experiment with different sizes and colors in casual games before heading into competitive matchmaking.</p></div>
